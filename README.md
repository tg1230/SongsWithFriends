# ECS 162 Final Project

## Songs With Friends

Bonus Features:

- Playback errors (host and peers) change the current song name until resolved
- Skipping tracks (by scrubbing to the end) works
- New peers that join after the playlist has started will sync
- If everyone that logs in logs out, the app will reset and the next person to login will become host
- Host can pause and unpause on their playback device and everyone else will pause *(most of the time)
- Host scrub works *(most of the time)
- Session recovers from playback errors for both hosts and clients *(most of the time)
- Muting and unmuting (to a set volume of 50) works *(most of the time)

Known Issues:

- Scrub and pause can be finnicky, seem to be delayed and missed sometimes
- Mute and unmute is very delayed after the firs time
- Session recovery can be finnicky (but everyone logging out and back in will reset everything)
